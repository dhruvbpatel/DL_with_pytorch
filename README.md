# DL_with_pytorch
**Deep neural Networks implemented using Pytorch** 


 - This  Repo consists of code for making Neural Networks and Hands-on Deep Learning with [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org)
- This Exercises are part of Secure and Private AI ScholarShip Challenge By Facebook on [Udacity](https://udacity.com) . 
-  Here is the brief of the course : [https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/secureprivateai-challenge/](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/secureprivateai-challenge/)

## Note:
 - All the code uploaded here is in format of .ipynb , it is advised to use Jupyter Notebooks for editing .
 - I recommend you to install Anaconda Distribution and use Jupyter Notebooks for working with these notebooks.
 - If you are working offline with these notebooks , please install necessary packages and libraries  for uninterrupted experience:
	 - **Numpy** (ignore if you have Installed Anaconda )
	 - **Matplotlib** (ignore if you have Installed Anaconda )
	 - **pandas** (ignore if you have Installed Anaconda )
	 - **[pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)** 
		 - run this command in anaconda prompt :
		 - `conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=9.0 -c pytorch`
