# DL_with_pytorch
**Deep neural Networks implemented using Pytorch** 


 - This  Repo consists of code for making Neural Networks and Hands-on Deep Learning with [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org)
- This Exercises are part of Secure and Private AI ScholarShip Challenge By Facebook on [Udacity](https://udacity.com) . 
-  Here is the brief of the course : [https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/secureprivateai-challenge/](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/secureprivateai-challenge/)

## Note:
 - All the code uploaded here are in both .py and .ipynb (notebook) format, it is advised to use Jupyter Notebooks for editing .
 - I recommend you to install Anaconda Distribution and use Jupyter Notebooks for working with these notebooks.
## Dependencies

To run these notebooks you'll need to install Python 3.6+, PySyft, Numpy, PyTorch 1.0, and Jupyter Notebooks. The easiest way for all of this is to create a conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n pysyft python=3
conda activate pysyft
conda install numpy jupyter notebook
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
pip install syft
```
